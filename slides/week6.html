                        <li>These dependencies are usually referred as DOC: depended-on-components</li>

                    <h2>State Verification</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inspect the state (<strong>direct output</strong>)of the SUT after it has been exercised and compare to the expected state/result</li>
                        <li>We can rely on just state verification when we only care about the end state of the SUT and we don't care about how it got there or any side effects that might occur when the SUT is exercised</li>
                        <li>We can only use state verification when the SUT or the components it depends on (DOC) produce direct output</li>
                        <li>There are two ways to do state verification:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Procedural: we just write assertions for each state variable that we care about</li>
                                <li>Expected State Specification: We consolidate all the state variables in a single object that we we can use to make an equality assertion</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Built-in Assertions</li>
                        <li>External Result Verification: e.g. verify file contents after the SUT has been executed, execute a database query.</li>
                        <li>Delta Assertions: Take a snapshot of the relevant objects / classes before the test and compare after the test.
                            <p class="fragment fade-in">Used when your tests use a Shared Fixture: for example when you are testing a method that adds records to a database and you need to use the same database for all your tests</p>

                    <h2>Behavior Verification</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Indirect outputs</strong> of the SUT are captured when the SUT is exercised and they are compared to the expected behavior</li>
                        <li>We need behavior verification when we can't determine the state of the SUT after the SUT has been exercised, when the SUT is not stateful, or when we care about side effects / calls made by the SUT</li>
                        <li>Behavior verification almost always involves interacting with DOCs.</li>

                                <li>A method/function that writes to a database?</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>We want unit tests to fail only if there is a failure on the SUT that we are testing, not on any of the DOC. Test should be isolated from potential failures/problems on the DOC</li>
                        <li>What happens when the SUT can not be tested in isolation?
